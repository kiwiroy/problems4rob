###Remove hurdles to HPC use
  It would be great to have a system where one can submit a compute job and the system 
  runs automatically on the compute system best fitting the compute requirements.
  Not having to worry about operating system, software environment, location specific ways
   of running a job, would ensure 
   (1) higher productivity for all users, 
   (2) optimized use of compute resources,
   (3) collaborating with other users is made easy.

###Pick your battles
This is not a problem but rather a word of advice.
If there is already a dedicated resource available globally that does (almost) exactly
what you need, try and use that resource and contribute to it rather than reinventing
the wheel for NZ.
For a project that captures the variation in 1000 sheep we are for example working with
the European Variant Archive. We give them all our SNP information and they host the data
for both querying and visualisation on their system.
